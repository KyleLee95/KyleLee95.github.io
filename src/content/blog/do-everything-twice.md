Strangely, I've come across this notion a few times in my life. At first I
thought it was silly. Why would I ever want to do something more than once,
especially in the context of school, work, or anything productivity related? If you have to do everything
twice then you're probably an idiot (or at the very least not very good at
things), right?

For example, in school students who can "just do it" are praised for being able
to do things on the first try. At work, employees are praised for doing things
correctly and efficiently. I doubt anyone is ever praised for going back and
doing something a second time. Have you ever heard of a client or employer who
is delighted by the fact that someone they hired took longer and costed them more?
Clearly this notion is nonsense... or is it?

In truth, I actually think it's more than a funny notion. I think it's extremely _good_ advice for many people to the point that
I'm willing to go to bat for it on the internet. I hope that by sharing the
times I was given this advice and how I've integrated it into my life that I
might convince you of it too.

The first time I was told to do something twice was in high school. My 9th and 10th grade English literature teachers both
suggested that the class should do each of the assigned readings twice. The first reading is meant to just be to understand the who, what, where, why, when, and how of the assigned pages. They insisted that the second time is intended to be for a close reading of the text-- to analyze the text for things like themes, devices, style, or motifs. Both teachers claimed that it trying to read for both in a single pass would mean that we would end up understanding neither the plot or being able to conduct any meaningful analysis.

The second time I came across this piece of advice was while I was watching _The
Primeagen_ (Prime) and he suggested that every programmer should build
everything twice. Prime argued that the first time a programmer builds something
is for _discovering what_ they're trying to build. It's not that programmers are
a dense breed that can't read requirements (although some might disagree) but
rather that the first build is for figuring out things like what problems they
might face, what they do and don't understand about the problem, and most importantly-- making mistakes.

Most recently, I was told by a former Mathematics professor that he believes that everyone should
take every Math class twice. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the first time a student
takes a class it's mostly struggling with the material, trying to pass the class, and mostly learning the mechanics. The second time around students have the opportunity to dive deep into whats in front of them, to be curious, and to explore without having to worry about figuring out how to get to the solution.

The pattern that I noticed in all of these instances was that the first time
you do anything you'll probably feel like an idiot, and that's ok! Unless you're
someone who either a) works in the field or b) is one of the gifted few who can
do just about anything first try, I would wager that you're probably like me--
awful at most things the first time you try doing it.

It's at this point that I'd say "Do everything
twice" really just means the key to success is to make mistakes, learn from them, and go again.
Do you _really_ want to do the work twice in order to get it right? No chance. Does it suck to make mistakes? Yes! Does it suck to be bad at something? Absolutely.But is it okay to do things twice if it means you're going to do it right? I'd argue the answer is yes.

# Notes

- Not applicable to _everything_ and you'd be an idiot to think that.
- and to people who can do things first try AND are assholes, fuck you.
